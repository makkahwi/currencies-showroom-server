# Currencies Showroom

Welcome to my "Currencies Showroom"

This originally is a coding project to learn the frontend tech used (Vue.Js), but it was decided to kill two birds with one stone. So beside mastering the tech, it's also to build an actual & usable web app to serve "money collection" hobbyists.

It's a web app to publish one's collection of currencies from all over the world to all over the world. Where collectors would clone this project & deploy it to enlist their currencies, and the public could just browse their showrooms right away.

## How to start development

- Clone repo to local machine
- Cd to root directory
- Run CLI commands of...
  - yarn install
  - yarn serve

## How to deploy & start using as a collector

    Cooming Soon...
